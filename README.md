# PROJECT2-MINI-ETL

For the ETL mini project(Crowdfunding_ETL), I practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After I transformed the data,I created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
